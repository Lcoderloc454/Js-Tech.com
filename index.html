                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                It all started back at the year 2024 where the economy is not doing great and entertainment in the digital world is at its boring time and when there are people out there that could use the help but got cast out we founded Js Tech to bring technologal advancements to entertainment, medical, job making, and more that can benefit humanity as the best it could and get technology to work along side with humanity instead of the fear of one side taking over the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, there is this thought wondering how is it all possible to achieve that? We have put our research into engineering, medical advancements and acessbility, seeing what consumers want for entertainment, security measures to keep people safe online, and using technology to bring more job opportunites so that way the economy can go into greater hights then ever before, and give the opportunity for humanity to work along side with technology instead of fearing its adaptation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We did started out as a simple computer company that focuses on fixing computers and selling our own to consumers along with our VR headset and gloves. But overtime we see a vision to put technology into its fullest capabilities to embrace the unkown and forge it.

                For our main goal that is to bring technology into its fullest capabilities and advance it as humanly possible and make technology into the ultimate option to bring a future that will make technology and humanity to its penical and highest standing.

            <p>
                Our vision is to see how far can technology could be pushed how much can it adapt some may say this company is forged out of the wealth or out of control even maybe from smart thinkers but our main purpose is to push technology of how far can it adapt and how much can it help humanity but it depends on how someone wants to use it.
